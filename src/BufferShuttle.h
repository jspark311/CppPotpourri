This class is intended to move large amounts of buffer over some I/O channel
  that would result in unacceptably high peak-memory usage.

NOTE: Instances of this class will require polling, and come with concurrency
  stipulations that will be difficult to meet in many cases, and cannot be
  controlled for in this class. Use this as a debug support tool, and not as a
  premise for actual production features.
NOTE: This class will not free buffers by default. If that behavior is desired,
  it should be requested following buffer definition. Be careful. There is no
  contract enforcement WRT to memory.
TODO: This should turn into a templated class to handle complex types that are
  reducible to buffers.
