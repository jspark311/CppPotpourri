These classes descend from ManuvrOS's core classes for asynchronous execution:
Kernel, EventReceiver, ManuvrMsg, and Scheduler.

Lessons learned from ManuvrOS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Originally, ManuvrOS's Kernel was intended to operate as pub-sub observer
  pattern, with observing drivers extending the EventReceiver virtual class and
  registering themselves with the Kernel upon instantiation. Events were handled
  by priority (first) and insertion order (second) via a callback defined in by
  the base class. Callbacks in EventReceiver would be called with a single
  ManuvrMsg as an argument.
This pattern functioned quite well for many applications, despite its inherent
  limitations with respect to event order and priority control.

All of these factors contributed to the putrefaction of the code base:
  1) EventReceiver became a catch-all for features that should have been handled
     independently. Logging (since solved), console handling (since solved),
     and asynchronicity of program operations all depended on extending an
     overly-complicated base class.
  2) The Kernel class (which was a singleton) became too intermingled with the
     Scheduler class and logging functions, thus necessitating platform
     non-generality.
  3) The event carrier class (ManuvrMsg) became too intermingled with schedules,
     and had an assigned ID map that implied hard-coded behaviors across modules
     that might respond to them. Combined with the ossification of
     EventReceiver, the class became brittle and evolved by agglomeration.
  4) ManuvrMsg became too intermingled with the Argument class (now
     KeyValuePair) for the sake of holding working data across parallel stacks.

Kernel's API allowed global event broadcasts in addition to the preferred
  pattern of publish-subscribe. But because it was a singleton, and the possible
  combination of EventReceiver's in a given program couldn't be predicted, the
  only reliable practice was often to use global broadcasts. This lead to
  horrendous CPU inefficiencies as the number of EventReceivers increased.


Kernel originally did two things right:
  1) It concentrated event handling in an orderly and thread-safe manner with a
     single polling loop for the entire program.
  2) It handled event scheduling in tandem with the on-demand event system, and
     did so with a simple API.

The architectural solution to all of this should be...
  1) Make tightly-restricted interface classes (or callback patterns) to replace
     the legitimate roles that EventReceiver/ManuvrMsg filled.
  2) Do away with the pub-sub pattern in Kernel, and replace it with a filter,
     or possibly nothing.
  3) Drop the singleton pattern in Kernel, and allow a B-tree relationship
     of (possibly) heterogeneous "event queues" to allow for isolation of
     concerns within each module that uses them. Kernel's replacement class
     should not rely on the heap. Use RingBuffer rather than PriorityQueue?
  4) Re-introduce the Scheduler more-or-less as it stood prior to its
     integration into ManuvrOS.

Ideally, the eventing system ought to be usable to cleanly implement either
  promise or observer patterns without reliance of those specific features in
  the C++ standard library. Lambdas are acceptable if they yield good results.
  Lambdas had worked well with ManuvrOS near the end of its evolution (see the
  BufferPipe setup in the linux demos).
  Experimentation is required on this front before the API is determined.

This arrangement ought to eventually replace the complexity in BusAdapter/BusOp.
