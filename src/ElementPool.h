/**
* Reclaims the given object so its memory can be re-used.
*
* At present, our criteria for preallocation is if the pointer address passed in
*   falls within the range of our _pool array. I see nothing "non-portable"
*   about this, it doesn't require a flag or class member, and it is fast to check.
* However, this strategy only works for types that are never used in DMA or code
*   execution on the STM32F4. It may work for other architectures (PIC32, x86?).
*   I also feel like it ought to be somewhat slower than a flag or member, but not
*   by such an amount that the memory savings are not worth the CPU trade-off.
* Consider writing all new cyclical queues with preallocated members to use this
*   strategy. Also, consider converting the most time-critical types to this strategy
*   up until we hit the boundaries of the STM32 CCM.
