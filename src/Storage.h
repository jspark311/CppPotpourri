This file represents the platform-agnostic interface to a persistent
  data storage mechanism. Firmware that wants to use local data that
  is not compiled-in as constants will need at least one class that
  extends this.

All calls to this class are async. So buffer safety is to be enforced by the
  platform-specific implementation. This might mean more than doubling the
  memory burden for hard-copies with the raw buffer API.

TODO: Move to BusQueue for callback support? Might get really messy.
