/*
* 2020.06.07
*
* A simple class for "Wake Locks", as an Android dev would understand it.
* This class was patterned after android.os.PowerManager.WakeLock:
*   https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/os/PowerManager.WakeLock
*
* At the time of writing, this API deviates in the following ways:
*   1) Obviously, no Java embroidery.
*   2) No encryption.
*   3) No discrete "Units" for specific functionality. Yet. Might still happen.
*   4) No notions of "WorkSource", but rather a reference to the faculty being
*        Locked (typically a piece of hardware). The interface class is implemented
*        by any class that wants to receive callbacks from the WakeLock object
*        which may be held by numerous other classes.
*
* NOTE/TODO: This class was not intended to be used under true multithreading.
*   There is no effort at concurrency control, apart from keeping things brief.
*   Might be OK if you confine WakeLock's entire call-stack to a single thread.
*   Just be warned....
