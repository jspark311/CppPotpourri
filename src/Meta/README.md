# Meta

This directory is the top of a special path in the library. Inclusion of
CppPotpourri.h activates this inclusion chain.

Nothing in this directory should be included by software outside of this
library, although the results of their inclusion can be relied upon to occur if
CppPotpourri.h is pulled in.


### Bikeshed

This directory is the appropriate place for things being considered, developed,
or retained for some other historical purpose. Nothing in this directory is here
forever. It should not be included except by informed developers that are in the
process of bikeshedding an idea.


### Boneyard

This is where obsolete classes or bad ideas go to die. They will only remain
here as long as there may still be something to learn from their failure or
retirement. Once that end is served, they will be deleted. Don't code against
anything in here. Odds are, it was always garbage.
